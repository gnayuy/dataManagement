		<h3>Welcome to DVID</h3>

		<p>This page provides an introduction to the currently running DVID server.  
		Developers can visit the <a href="https://github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid">Github repo</a> 
		for more documentation and code.
		The <a href="http://localhost:8000/">DVID admin console</a> may be available if you have downloaded the
		<a href="https://github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid-console">DVID console web client repo</a>
		and included <i>-webclient=/path/to/console</i> when running the
		<code>dvid serve</code> command.</p>
		
		<h3>HTTP API and command line use</h3>

		<p>All API endpoints follow this layout:
		</p><pre>/serverhost:someport/api/...
		</pre>
		The online documentation doesn't show the server host prefixed to the "/api/..." URL,
		but it is required.

		<h4>General commands</h4>

		<pre> GET  /api/help

	The current page that lists all general and type-specific commands/HTTP API.

 GET  /api/help/{typename}

	Returns help for the given datatype.

 GET  /api/load

	Returns a JSON of server load statistics.

 GET  /api/server/info

	Returns JSON for server properties.

 GET  /api/server/types

	Returns JSON with the datatypes of currently stored data instances.  Datatypes are represented
	by a name and the URL of the reference implementation.  To see all possible datatypes, i.e., the
	list of compiled datatypes, use the "compiled-types" endpoint.

 GET  /api/server/compiled-types

 	Returns JSON of all possible datatypes for this server, i.e., the list of compiled datatypes.

POST  /api/server/settings

	Sets server parameters.  Expects JSON to be posted with optional keys denoting parameters:
	{
		"gc": 500,
		"throttle": 2
	}

	 
	Possible keys:
	gc        Garbage collection target percentage.  This is a low-level server tuning
	            request that can affect overall request latency.
	            See: https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetGCPercent

	throttle  Maximum number of CPU-intensive requests that can be executed under throttle mode.
	            See imageblk and labelblk GET 3d voxels and POST voxels.
	            Default = 1.


POST  /api/server/reload-metadata

	Reloads the metadata from storage.  This is useful when using multiple DVID frontends with 
	a shared storage backend.  Typically, one DVID is designated "master" and handles any
	modifications of the repositories and data instances.  Other DVIDs simply reload the metadata 
	when prompted by an external coordinator, allowing the "slave" DVIDs to see changes made by
	the master DVID.


-------------------------
Repo-Level REST endpoints
-------------------------

 POST /api/repos

	Creates a new repository.  Expects configuration data in JSON as the body of the POST.
	Configuration is a JSON object with optional "alias", "description", and "passcode"
    properties.  Returns the root UUID of the newly created repo in JSON object: {"root": uuid}

 GET  /api/repos/info

	Returns JSON for the repositories under management by this server.

 HEAD /api/repo/{uuid}

	Returns 200 if a repo with given UUID is available.

 GET  /api/repo/{uuid}/info

	Returns JSON for just the repository with given root UUID.  The UUID string can be
	shortened as long as it is uniquely identifiable across the managed repositories.

 POST /api/repo/{uuid}/instance

	Creates a new instance of the given data type.  Expects configuration data in JSON
	as the body of the POST.  Configuration data is a JSON object with each property
	corresponding to a configuration keyword for the particular data type.  

	JSON name/value pairs:

	REQUIRED "typename"   Type name of the new instance,
	REQUIRED "dataname"   Name of the new instance
	OPTIONAL "versioned"  If "false" or "0", the data is unversioned and acts as if 
	                      all UUIDs within a repo become the root repo UUID.  (True by default.)
	
  GET /api/repo/{uuid}/log
 POST /api/repo/{uuid}/log

	GETs or POSTs log data to the repo with given UUID.  The get or post body should 
	be JSON of the following format: 

	{ "log": [ "provenance data...", "provenance data...", ...] }

	The log is a list of strings that will be appended to the repo's log.  They should be
	descriptions for the entire repo and not just one node.  For particular versions, use
	node-level logging (below).

 POST /api/repo/{uuid}/merge

	Creates a conflict-free merge of a set of committed parent UUIDs into a child.  Note
	the merge will not necessarily create an error immediately, but later GETs that
	detect conflicts will produce an error at that time.  These can be resolved by
	doing a POST on the "resolve" endpoint below.

	The post body should be JSON of the following format: 

	{ 
		"mergeType": "conflict-free",
		"parents": [ "parent-uuid1", "parent-uuid2", ... ],
		"note": "this is a description of what I did on this commit"
	}

	The elements of the JSON object are:

		mergeType:  must be "conflict-free".  We will introduce other merge options in future.
		parents:    a list of the parent UUIDs to be merged. 
		note:       any note that should be set for the child version.

	A JSON response will be sent with the following format:

	{ "child": "3f01a8856" }

	The response includes the UUID of the new merged, child node.

 POST /api/repo/{uuid}/resolve

	Forces a merge of a set of committed parent UUIDs into a child by specifying a
	UUID order that establishes priorities in case of conflicts (see "parents" description
	below.  

	Unlike the very fast but lazily-enforced 'merge' endpoint, this request spawns an 
	asynchronous routine that checks all data for the given data instances (see "data" in
	JSON post), creates versions to delete conflicts, and then performs the conflict-free 
	merge to a final child.  

	The post body should be JSON of the following format: 

	{ 
		"data": [ "instance-name-1", "instance-name2", ... ],
		"parents": [ "parent-uuid1", "parent-uuid2", ... ],
		"note": "this is a description of what I did on this commit"
	}

	The elements of the JSON object are:

		data:       A list of the data instance names to be scanned for possible conflicts.
		parents:    A list of the parent UUIDs to be merged in order of priority.  If 
		             there is a conflict between the second and third UUID, the conflicting
		             data in the third UUID will be deleted in favor of the second UUID.
		note:       Any note that should be set for the child version.

	A JSON response will be sent with the following format:

	{ "child": "3f01a8856" }

	The response includes the UUID of the new merged, child node.


-------------------------
Node-Level REST endpoints
-------------------------

  GET /api/node/{uuid}/log
 POST /api/node/{uuid}/log

	GETs or POSTs log data to the node (version) with given UUID.  The get or post body should 
	be JSON of the following format: 

	{ "log": [ "provenance data...", "provenance data...", ...] }

	The log is a list of strings that will be appended to the node's log.  They should be
	data usable by clients to reconstruct the types of operation done to that version
	of data.

 POST /api/node/{uuid}/commit

	Commits (locks) the node/version with given UUID.  This is required before a version can 
	be branched or pushed to a remote server.  The post body should be JSON of the 
	following format: 

	{ 
		"note": "this is a description of what I did on this commit",
		"log": [ "provenance data...", "provenance data...", ...] 
	}

	The note is a human-readable commit message.  The log is a slice of strings that may
	be computer-readable.

	If successful, a valid JSON response will be sent with the following format:

	{ "committed": "3f01a8856" }

 POST /api/node/{uuid}/branch

	Creates a new child node (version) of the node with given UUID.  

	An optional post body should be in JSON format:

	{ "note": "this is what we'll be doing on this version" }

	A JSON response will be sent with the following format:

	{ "child": "3f01a8856" }

	The response includes the UUID of the new child node.

		<p>Background batch processes like generation of tiles, sparse volumes, and various
		   indices, will be paused if a single server receives more than a few data type API r
		   requests over a 5 minute moving window.  You can mark your API request as
		   non-interactive (i.e., you don't mind if it's delayed) by appending a query string
		   <code>interactive=false</code>.
